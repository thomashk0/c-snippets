# Collection of Reusable C libraries

This repository contains a set of simple reusable C libraries (C99).

Each library tries (very hard) to be portable (single-header if possible), minimal, self-contained (no dependency) and well-tested.
The license can differ for each library. Please, refer to the `LICENSE` files in each subdirectories.

## Index of Libraries

* [c_base64](./c_base64): base64 encoding and decoding.
* [survival](./survival/): some survival macros, always nice to include in C projects!
